She wakes up again in the dusty room.

She had lost count the time she had fallen asleep, forgotten how many monsters she had slain, and had no idea where she is at.

Yet she understands that she must escape from this crazy maze.

She pushes open the dusty iron door, from where her journey continues.

Project Gearbox is a 2d platformer about parkour and battle. You act as an maid lost inside an dangerous city, wander in the alleys and rooftops, fighting with various dangerous monsters. While going forward, you look for the ways to escape this huge cage.

In Gearbox, we try to incoporate realistic parkour movements and a set of solid battle actions. Player will be able to smoothly transit between parkour and battle, and engage monsters with multiple actions and combos.

The project is still in early developement stage, we hope to hear more opinions from everyone! :-)
