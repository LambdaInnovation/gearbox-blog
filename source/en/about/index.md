We are a group of students in China with passion to game developement.

We met on Internet for the developement of some [Minecraft-related projects](http://li-dev.cn), but making indie games had always been our dream. This will be our first step towards that goal :-)

# Developers

**Game Design, Programming**

The one who codes. I am a CS(Computer Science) student, and had previous experiences in Minecraft modding and web backend programming. Especially good at rendering-related stuffs.

I've been practicing parkour for ~7 yrs and really loves it, and that's probably why we had so much parkour elements in this game >)
