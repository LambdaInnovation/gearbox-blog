Hi there! I'm WeAthFolD, the main programmer of the project, also in charge of part of the game design. In this devblog I will introduce our game idea and mechanics, also giving a progress report about how we are doing currently.

This game, currently called Project Gearbox, is a game about parkour and action. Player will wander in a maze-like procedurally generated city and engage various monsters and boses, while revealing the secret of the city.

Here is a concept drawn by our artist, Nolife_M:

We have made several prototypes to test and nail down the basic gameplay. We want this game to be an intense and flow-like experience, where player continiously run and fight without long halt —— An infinite runner flavor with the mix of action game.

In last week I finished the basic player controller, so the player is able to roam in the environment and climb the obstacles using basic parkour movements such as speed vault and wall push ups. While Nolife working on more player actions such as attack actions and combos.

Next week will be a very busy one. We have to make some monsters to test fight mechanisms, and make some basic levels. A whole load of work! So see you next week >)
